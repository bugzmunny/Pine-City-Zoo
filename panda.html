            <h3>PANDA</h3>
            <P>Pandas are universally recognised and an international treasure. These charismatic bears hold a special place in the hearts of animal and nature lovers around the world. The giant panda is also the flagship species of WWF and has been our emblem since 1961. These iconic species represent both at-risk wildlife and their fragile habitats.

Adopting a panda is a symbol of your compassion for all endangered species and their homes, locally and globally.

Across our planet, billions of animals face daily threats to their livelihoods, caused by dangers such as illegal wildlife trade, poaching, climate change and deforestation. Unless we make changes now, weâ€™ll soon lose the animals and plants that make our Earth so unique.</p>
