            <h3>GEMSBOK</h3>
            <P>As they stand proud on a red Kalahari dune, gemsbok antelope (AKA South African oryx) look like members of an immaculately clad presidential guard.</P>

<p>Their rapier horns, striking face masks, sleek fawn-and-black bodies and proud, horsey tails look like uniforms dreamt up by a top designer.</p> 

<p>But good looks are just part of reason these stunning animals are so remarkable. They can also endure astonishingly hot temperatures, allowing their bodies to heat up beyond the point where most animals would collapse from heat exhaustion.</p> <p> They avoid damaging their brains through an intricate network of arteries that cool the blood. 

They can deliberately slow their metabolisms to use less energy.</p> And by breathing more slowly and deeply, these buck (in South Africa, ‘buck’ or ‘bok’ is a generic word for an antelope, male or female) also minimise the moisture lost through exhaling.</p>
 <p><strong>Where will you find them</strong></p>
      <p><strong>You will find the gemsbok at pen K9, right next to the greenhouse.</strong></p>
